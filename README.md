# X11 Desktop Recording Script Using [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
---

This is a simple BASH/Shell script for recording desktop video & audio using FFmpeg. Currently it is specific to my system. Many values may need changed for it to work on other systems. I have plans to eventually make a GUI tool, so this is what I am using for the time being.
